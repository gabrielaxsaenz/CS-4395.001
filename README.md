# Portfolio Assignment 0
 This [assignment](Overview-of-NLP.pdf) allowed me to review historical and modern approaches to NLP while reflecting on what I will be learning in this course.
# Portfolio Assignment 1
 In [this assignment](Homework1_gvs180000.py), I worked on a program that managed employee data from an obselete file. 
 The problem can be run in the terminal with the command "python3 Homework1_gvs180000.py data/data.csv" 
  Note: the filepath "data/data.csv" may be different on your local machine, but the .csv file MUST be located in the same file as the .py file
 By completing this assignment in python, I was able to use the text processing tools and functions that python has to offer.
 For example, Python has a very intuitive process for identifying variables, making it easy to move between different types of variables such as lists or strings.
 In addition, Python is good for text processing because the dictionary data structure keeps objects well organized.
 Throughout this assignment I learned that Python offers easy to learn and use syntax and structure to its language. Also, I learned how to simplify the functions I use
 when processing text to make a more efficient program.
 
 # Portfolio Assignment 2
  In [assignment 2](Assignment2_gvs180000.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf) I worked in Google Colab to demonstrate use of NLTK.
